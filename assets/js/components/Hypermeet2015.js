          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            HyperMeet is a Liero Championship held every summer since 2006
            (with the exception of 2010 and 2011) that is known as the
            semi-official World Championship in Liero. Last year it was held
            in Poland and was won by MrEvil from Germany. In 2015 we are proud
            to announce that LieroGBG hosted this spectacular event!
